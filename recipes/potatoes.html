    <img src="../images/potatoes1.jpg" width="400px" alt="Hasselback potatoes" />
    <p>Hasselback potatoes are thinly sliced potatoes that are roasted to golden brown perfection, then topped with cheese, bacon, sour cream & green onions.</p>
      <p>With just a little more effort than a plain baked potato, you can make these showy Hasselback potatoes. They are easy to make and encompass two favorite potato textures – edges that are crispy like your favorite French fries with a creamy center reminiscent of mashed. </p>
    <p>The below basic Hasselback potatoes recipe will make you look like a cooking whiz and using Idaho Potatoes that will prove that you clearly have a discerning taste!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>4 large Potatoes</li>
<li>Lemon juice</li>
<li>4 tablespoons butter or oil</li>
<li>Fresh rosemary</li>
<li>1 large clove garlic, sliced</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
<li>Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
<li>Prepare a bowl of cold water with a squeeze of lemon juice in it. Slice off the bottom of each Idaho® Russet Potato lengthwise to make them steadier for cutting. </li>
  <li>Place potato between two chopsticks. Cut slits 1/4 apart using the chopsticks as a guide to keep from cutting all the way through. The slices should stay connected at the bottom. </li>
    <li>Carefully fan out the sliced pieces without breaking them apart. Place the cut potato in the prepared bowl of water while you cut the remaining potatoes.</li>
<li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add a couple of sprigs of rosemary, the sliced garlic, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Let it sit a few minutes to season the butter.</li>
<li>Remove potatoes from water and dry thoroughly and place them on a baking sheet. </li>
  <li>Brush the potatoes with some of the melted butter and bake for 1 hour. </li>
    <li>Halfway through cooking, the potatoes will start to fan out. When this happens, brush with some more of the melted butter.</li>
<li>Remove from the oven. Brush with remaining butter, sprinkle with salt, and garnish with chopped parsley.</li>
<li>Serve right away while still hot from the oven.</li>
</ol>
