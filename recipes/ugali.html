    <h1>Kenyan Ugali Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/ugali.jpg" width="400px" alt="Ugali" />
    <p>Ugali is served as an accompaniment to meat, fish or vegetable stews. 
    To eat ugali, pull off a small ball of mush with your fingers, form an indentation with your thumb and use it to scoop up tasty stews and other dishes.</p>
  <p>Ugali is made by constantly mixing maize flour or cornmeal with hot water over heat until it reaches a dough-like consistency. Maize flour is the most often used, but you can also use millet flour, cassava flour, or sorghum.</p>

    <p>In Kenyan villages, people prefer a heavier flour made by grinding maize in a mill without removing any nutrients. 
    The denser the ugali, the more filling and nutritious.</p>

<p>This recipe is for four to six people.</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Maize flour (milled)</li>
  <li>Water</li>
  <li>A pinch of Salt</li>
  <li>Margarine</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Add six cups of water either hot or cold in a sizable  cooking pot.</li>
  
  <li>Boil the water in a heavy cooking pot <i>(6"- 8" diameter).</i></li> 
    <li><b>Optional:</b> Add a pinch of salt and a spoon.</li>
    <li>Pour in four cups of flour slowly and at the same time start to stir it gently.</li>
<li>Reduce heat to medium-low and continue stirring regularly, smashing any lumps that may form with a cooking stick.</li>
  <li>As ugali continues to cook, it gets very thick. You can continue adding flour until it is thicker than mashed potatoes.</li>
  <li>Leave it cooking for about 15 minutes, but make sure you keep turning it so that it does not get burned.</li>
  <li>Using the cooking stick, mash/pad it into a dome shape. Tip out your ugali onto a serving bowl.</li>
</ol>
